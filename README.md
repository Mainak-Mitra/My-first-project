# üëè Welcome!

### What is Cronodes?

Cronodes is a fork of a DeFi as a Service (DaaS) platform (Thor) from the Avalanche Network. We have seen the DaaS platform on many different networks, but Cronodes dreamed of bringing the idea to the Cronos chain. We believe that the Cronos chain is going to gain serious traction in the next year with the marketing push that Crypto.com is doing. From advertising everywhere, Superbowl Ads, and even buying out the LA Lakers stadium name. That's right, the LA Lakers stadium is now called the Crypto.com Arena. This crazy unprecedented marketing push, in our opinion, is going to open the flood gate to normal everyday retail investors and we wanted to be one of the first good projects on the Cronos chain.
