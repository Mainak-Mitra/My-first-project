This is our current roadmap, it is subject to change as we are in an ever-changing space.

\*EDIT\*\
We removed the KYC portion of our roadmap due to a variable set of reasons. On Feb 19th, 2 KYCd projects rugged. The KYC platforms did not do their job in retrieving the information of the project creators. This essentially means that there is no security to an investor through KYC. For the past weeks, the team has chatted with community members and had agreed, for the most part, that KYC is out the window. There is no reason to invest money into a concept that provides no reassurance to the investors. The team has also already recieved death threats of memebers losing some CRN in failure to follow simple directions. That certainly makes us uneasy, considerin we are just trying to make this project the very best we can.
